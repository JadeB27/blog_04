            <p>This article talks about how AI running on a Quantum computer can now generate recognisable images, like shoes, 
                pants and shirts. My thoughts on this article is it is scary. I was listening to a podcast and they were explaining
                how chatgbt and other AI websites do not run on Quantum computers, so it is not that scary yet. Basically it was just spitting
                out things humans have already put on the internet and was not able to "fact check" becuase it doesn't know true or false apose to
                what humans have said on the internet. But this article is confirming that we now have AI generators in Quantum computers, which scares
                me because those computers can fact check and remove false information on its own, without the need for humans.

            <p>This article talks about the physics behind neuromorphic computing. It basically explains how they are mimicking topology of the brain.
                neuromorphic computing is a method of computer engineering where elements of a computer are modeled after systems in the human brain and nervous system,
                which I find very intriguing to read about because I have never seen or heard about anything like this.

            <p>This article talks about how they are testing organ donation via drone. he flight was operated from Dallas using robotic technology, marking the first time 
                donated organs were transported that far by a drone. The only issues they had were a bit of delay depending on the wind conditions. When approved by the FAA, 
                the aerial organ transportation would be used to transport organs across rural, South Texas areas, including Edinburg, McAllen and Brownsville. I chose this 
                article because this is life changing technology they are finally using for something like this.

            <a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-iphone-15-issues-bugs">Article link</a>
            <p>This article talks about the new IPhone 15 and its issues. For such an expensive phone this article explains how there are issues like overheating, freezes during
                the setup, the IOS is slow and laggy, it attracts too many fingerprints, and it breaks too easily. All these things intrest me because Apple usually does a pretty 
                good job at this stuff, especially the durability of the phone.

            <p>This article talks about Black American Portraits and how it reframes the history of portraiture to center Black American subjects, sitters, and spaces. I wanted to
                do an art article, I chose this one because I think the message it sends is really beautiful.
